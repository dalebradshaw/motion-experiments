    @discussion This is not the same as the percentage of distance along the path. (For that, use
                pointAtPercentageOfDistance:alongPath:atTime:error:) In areas of high curvature
                along the path, there will be a greater percentage of points along the curve in
                parametric space, whereas in areas of low curvature, there will be fewer points
                along the curve.
