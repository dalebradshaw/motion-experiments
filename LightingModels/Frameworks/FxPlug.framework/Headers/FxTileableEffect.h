                When instantiating an FxImageTileRequest array using
                @c initWithSource:time:includeFilters:parameterID:, the currently supported keys for
                FxImageTileRequestSource are:
 
                @c kFxImageTileRequestSourceNone       - Not associated with an effect or parameter.
 
                @c kFxImageTileRequestSourceEffectClip - Request frame from the source clip.
 
                @c kFxImageTileRequestSourceParameter  - Request frame from an image well parameter.
 
                @c kFxImageTileRequestSourceOutput     - The output of the plugin.
 
                @c time should indicate the requested CMTime of the input, @c includeFilters will
                indicate if the plugin requires frames after leading filter effects have already
                been applied, and @c parameterID will indicate the ID of the effect source (0) or
                image well.
    @result     Return YES if you were able to successfully create the inputImageRequests array.
                Return NO if you were not able to for some reason. When returning NO, be sure to
                also set the error parameter to a descriptive value.
