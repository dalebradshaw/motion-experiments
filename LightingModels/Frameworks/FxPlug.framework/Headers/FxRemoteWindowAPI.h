    @discussion Call this method to request that the host creates a new window for you to display custom UI.
                The reply block will get the window's remote content view for your plug-in to put its views into.
                If there are any problems creating the window, parentView will be nil and error will contain
                an NSError describing the problem.
                Note that each plug-in instance can only have a single window. Subsequent calls to this method
                without the user closing the window will result in the same parent view being returned.

                UI.
    @param      minContentSize  -> The minimum content size requested

                will contain the reason why.
