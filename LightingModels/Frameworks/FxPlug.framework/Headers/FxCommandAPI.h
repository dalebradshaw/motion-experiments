    @constant   kFxCommand_PreviousMarker           Move the playhead to the previous marker of the currently selected object.
    @constant   kFxCommand_NextMarker               Move the playhead to the next marker of the currently selected object.

    @constant   kFxCommand_ReversePlayback          Jog in reverse (unavailable in Motion).
    @constant   kFxCommand_PausePlayback            Pauses playback in FCPX. In Motion, use TogglePlayback instead.
    @constant   kFxCommand_ForwardPlayback          Jog forward (use TogglePlayback in Motion).
    @constant   kFxCommand_TogglePlayback           If paused, starts playback; if playing back, pauses.
    @constant   kFxCommand_Undo                     Undo the last change.
    @constant   kFxCommand_Redo                     Redo the last undone change.
    @constant   kFxCommand_ToggleWaveforms          Show the waveforms scope in FCPX (unavailable in Motion).
    @constant   kFxCommand_ToggleInspectorHeight    Toggles the full-height inspector in FCPX (Motion's Inspector is always full-height).
    @constant   kFxCommand_ToggleSidebar            Toggles the Sidebar in FCPX or the Library in Motion.
    @constant   kFxCommand_ToggleEvents             Toggles the event viewer in FCPX or the Media tab in Motion.
    @constant   kFxCommand_Preferences              Shows the application's preferences.

                            Each element of the array is an NSDictionary containing 3 key-value pairs for
                            the keys: kKey_Command, kKey_Character, and kKey_Modifiers.
                            Note that if a command does not have a key equivalent assigned in the host application,
                            the kKey_Character key will have a value of 0. Each application may implement
                            only a subset of the desired commands. Furthermore, there may be more than one
                            key combination assigned to a given function. You should support all of them.
    @discussion If your plug-in displays its own custom window, you may wish to support the passing of some key presses
                to the application in order for the application to handle them. This method gives you a mapping from
                some common functions that plug-ins would like to pass on to the host application to their key commands.
                This method will be called whenever the user changes the key bindings for the application.
